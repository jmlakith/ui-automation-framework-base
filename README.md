# ui-automation-framework-base

UI Test Automation frameworks are very popular but when it comes to the quality of code
scarcity of OOP concepts, tightly coupled with the automation framework's keywords
and lack of simplicity emerged. Here, I have separated 
the testing logic from Selenium framework and from its keywords. 
Which will ease the integration of other UI test automation frameworks or replace 
the existing one, connected to your testing logic.
As a summary, Your logic is portable among any UI automation frameworks if you use this.
